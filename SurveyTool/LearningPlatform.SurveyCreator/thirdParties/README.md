# Third parties storage

This folder is used to store third-party libraris. We can download any library and store here.
But we need to know some important things:

- Prefer using `npm` or `bower` if you want to use third party library in formal way
- When you download third party library and store it here, please "Don't customize any thing in the library"
- If you want to customize third party libraries, please set them inside **scripts** folder
